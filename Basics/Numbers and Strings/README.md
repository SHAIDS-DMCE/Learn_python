# Numbers and Strings

Like other programming languages, C++, Java, etc. There's no need to declare variable in python.You can directly use them without declaring.<br>Because, python in completely object oriented and not "statically typed". Every variable in Python is an object.


## Numbers
Python supports, 
- Integer (Whole numbers)
- Floating point numbers (decimals)

for example
```bash
num = 7  ---> Integer value
print(num)

decimal = 6.5  ---> float value
print(decimal)

num = float(num) ---> converting Integer to float (Typecasting)
print(num)
```
 output
```bash
7
6.5 
7.0
```
## Strings
Strings are either defined in single quote or double quote.

For example,
```bash
String1 = 'Hello World!' ---> Using Single quote

String2 = "That's my phone" ---> Using Double quote

print(String1)

print(String2) 
```
output
```bash
Hello World!
That's my phone
```
